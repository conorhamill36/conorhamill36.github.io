I was fortunate enough to hit my Goodreads challenge of 15 books, with a bonus one snuck in as my immune system confined me to the indoors, with a good spread across fiction and non-fiction!</p> <h1 id="fantasy-and-sci-fi">Fantasy and sci-fi</h1> <ul> <li> <em>Lyra’s Oxford</em>, Philip Pullman</li> <li> <em>Once Upon a Time in the North</em>, Philip Pullman</li> <li> <em>A Day of Fallen Night</em>, Samantha Shannon</li> </ul> <p>I started off this year reading the novella’s based in Philip Pullman’s world of <em>His Dark Materials</em> and <em>The Book of Dust</em>, <em>Once Upon a Time in the North</em> and <em>Lyra’s Oxford</em>. I’ve always loved this world but never got round to reading these short books, which served as a nice holdover over until the third and final book in the trilogy gets released, <a href="https://x.com/PhilipPullman/status/1824487662528393639" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">which I think we can be pretty confident of having a release date next year</a>! Lyra’s Oxford depicts her life in Oxford after the events of <em>The Amber Spyglass</em> in a short story that has some links into <em>The Secret Commonwealth</em>. It expands on the Oxford that exists in the world of <em>His Dark Materials</em>, along with some maps and other documents that flesh out the world a bit more. <em>Once Upon a Time in the North</em> is a short story describing the first meeting of Iorek and Lee Scoresby, two fan favourite characters from <em>His Dark Materials</em>. I liked both of these novellas, but wouldn’t consider either of them mandatory reading for the series as a whole, although <em>Lyra’s Oxford</em> does give a nice introduction to some characters we encounter again in The Secret Commonwealth, and returning to Philip Pullman’s world is always a treat.</p> <p><em>A Day of Fallen Night</em> by Samantha Shannon is a prequel to 2019’s <em>The Priory of the Orange Tree</em>, which introduced her fantasy world of diverse cultures in a “feminist retelling of Saint George and the Dragon”. While I’m probably not the exact target audience for these books, like the previous title, <em>A Day of Fallen Night</em> was a great read. Some of the issues in pacing and characterisation have definitely improved since the last book, and I think this will only get better as Shannon re-visits the rich fantasy world of <em>Roots of Chaos</em> that she’s created.</p> <h1 id="horror">Horror</h1> <ul> <li> <em>Pet Sematary</em>, Stephen King</li> </ul> <p>In terms of horror books, I had a fairly limited year, but <em>Pet Sematary</em> was a real stand out among all the books I read. This was a fantastic read and I can see why it’s always highlighted as one of King’s best, so I would definitely recommend to any horror fans or anyone who has enjoyed his other works. This book is definitely up there with some of King’s most distributing, and he recently said himself <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/03/29/pet-sematary-stephen-king-interview/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“This is awful. This is really f—ing terrible.”</a>. While I think <em>The Shining</em> is still his scariest book, this definitely stands out as his most horrifying.</p> <h1 id="crime-and-espionage">Crime and espionage</h1> <ul> <li> <em>Thirteen</em>, Steve Cavanagh</li> <li> <em>Absolute Friends</em>, John le Carre</li> <li> <em>Strip Jack</em>, Ian Rankin</li> </ul> <p><em>Thirteen</em> by Steve Cavanagh came with the recommendation of Chris Dillon, and it did not disappoint. A really great thriller and I want to make sure I try more of Cavanagh’s stuff in 2025.</p> <p><em>Absolute Friends</em> by John le Carre was a kind lend from Thomas Lee, who is responsible for introducing me to the works of le Carre. This is definitely one of le Carre’s lesser known novels, covering a friendship across many decades of the 20th century across divided Europe, and feels like one of le Carre’s works that might have a hint of self-insertion in it. While the ending is a little bit out of left field, I would recommend this as one for fans of slow burn espionage to pick up.</p> <p>I finished up <em>Strip Jack</em> recently, and it’s a great entry to the Rebus series, with a tight and focussed story. As one of the earlier Rebus novels, characters like Siobhan and Cafferty are present, but I found I didn’t miss them that much. Would recommend to any Rebus or Scottish crime fans.</p> <h1 id="other-fiction">Other fiction</h1> <ul> <li> <em>Watership Down</em>, Richard Adams</li> <li> <em>Go Set a Watchman</em>, Harper Lee</li> <li> <em>Close to Home</em>, Michael Magee</li> <li> <em>Foster</em>, Claire Keegan</li> </ul> <p>With only vague memories of watching the TV show as a child, I found <em>Watership Down</em> a really enjoyable book, that lived up to its reputation of being filled with adventure, great characters, and conflict you wouldn’t expect in a book about rabbits. I was amazed at the depth of the rabbit lore and how well the story stands up, but I’m not sure who I would recommend this to - a bit too horrifying for young children, but maybe not what a lot of adults are looking for, but doesn’t really fit into young adult fiction? Anyway, it doesn’t matter - a great book that remains rightfully considered as a classic.</p> <p>Overall, I think I enjoyed <em>Go Set a Watchman</em> a lot more than the near-universal negative response it got when it was published. It’s definitely a strange book, especially given how established and influential its predecessor is. For me, it seemed to meander quite a bit, then jump to it’s conclusion all of a sudden. It nearly felt like there was another act, or another entire novel, that could have been there to describe how Scout arrived at the final state of her relationship with father. It really does feel like a shame that this is what we got from the Lee estate, but does not diminish any significance of the first book.</p> <p>Close to Home by Michael Magee was a standout novel of the year for me. This semi-autobiographical work based in modern Belfast tackles dealing with the past, finding personal identity, and the working class in Belfast.</p> <p><em>Foster</em> by Claire Keegan was a wonderfully written novella, depicting life in rural Ireland, and I definitely want to read more of her works in 2025.</p> <h1 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h1> <ul> <li> <em>Monsters</em>, Claire Dederer</li> <li> <em>You Don’t Have to Be Mad to Work Here</em>, Benji Waterhouse</li> <li> <em>Not the End of the World</em>, Hannah Ritchie</li> <li> <em>GCHQ</em>, Richard J. Aldrich</li> <li> <em>The Future of Geography</em>, Tim Marshall</li> </ul> <p><em>You Don’t Have to Be Mad to Work Here</em> by Dr. Benji Waterhouse was an enlightening and funny dive into the world of psychiatry, as well as Benji’s personal life. This book had a fantastic opening dedication and I’d hugely recommend.</p> <p><em>Not the End of the World</em> by Hannah Ritchie was another great non-fiction reads of this year, with an optimistic outlook on what we can do to make our planet sustainable. Would give this a wholehearted recommendation for anyone. We were also lucky enough to see Hannah Ritchie present this book at the wonderful <a href="https://www.toppingbooks.co.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Topping Books</a> in Edinburgh, where she was able to answer any and all questions about her research on the spot! She also has a great substack, <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sustainability by Numbers</a>, where she continues to share about the climate and data.</p> <p><em>Monsters</em> by Claire Dederer was a good read that starts off trying to answer the question “how can we enjoy great art made by terrible people?”, a question that has only become more pertinent as the number of artists found guilty of various crimes rises. This book diverted into a more autobiographical work as it went along, and while I’m not sure if it fully answered the question it set out to answer, I enjoyed the analysis of the history of people who have created notable works. The history of the UK’s intelligence, security and cyber agency is covered in <em>GCHQ</em> by Richard J. Aldrich. I learnt a lot about the organisation and its role in the Cold War, with the final 100 pages being the most interesting as GCHQ finds its place in the modern age, but some of the sections were quite dense and weighed down by the amount of information in them.</p> <p><em>The Future of Geography</em> by Tim Marshall was another great work by the author of <em>Prisoners of Geography</em>. The history of the space race during the Cold War and the competition for space in the 21st century will change our world were great reads and I would recommend this to any geography, politics, or space nerd.</p> <h1 id="substacksblogs">Substacks/blogs</h1> <p>This year I got a bit more into Substack, which has become a pleasant spot on the internet for people to write about their niche interests, with authors having control over what content is paid for and readers not being swamped by adverts.</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Silver Bulletin</a>, by Nate Silver <ul> <li>This blog covers analysis on elections, media, and sports and was a great resource for interpreting data during the 2024 US election.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="https://verynormal.substack.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Very Normal</a> by Christian Pascual <ul> <li>This substack focuses on an approachable manner to teaching concepts statistics, and Christian also has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@very-normal" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sustainability by Numbers</a>, by Hannah Ritchie <ul> <li>I’ve mentioned this above, but this substack focuses on applying data to understand the challenges facing our climate, from the author of <em>Not the End of the World</em>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="https://edinburghminute.substack.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Edinburgh Minute</a>, by Michael MacLeod <ul> <li>This doesn’t quite fit among the other substacks, but for local news in Edinburgh, this daily newsletter can’t be beaten.
