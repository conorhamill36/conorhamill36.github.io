I represented NatWest Group at the careers event at the [2024 STFC Nuclear Physics Summer School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1378624/) in Durham.
This event was sponsored by NatWest Group and I had the chance to answer questions as part of a panel of former nuclear physics PhD students and talk to students about my experience moving from academia to data science in financial services.
It was great to tell some of the students how relevant I've found the skills I picked up in my PhD for my current role and thrilling to hear about the huge range of nuclear physics research going on, including a wide range of machine learning applications!
