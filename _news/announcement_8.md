Raad Khraishi and I represented NatWest at the [2024 Neural Information Processing (NeurIPS) conference](https://neurips.cc) in Vancouver.
NatWest Group were [bronze sponsors of the conference](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/Sponsors) highlighting their commitment to AI research.
This was a brilliant experience to see the cutting edge of AI and machine learning research, including the current frontiers in large language models, AI agents, and reinforcement learning, as well as some seminal talks by some of the most prominent names in machine learning and computer science.
